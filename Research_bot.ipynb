They’re going to have that choice’\\n\\nBesides the economic blockade, the first deportation flight back to the island in decades suggests that reverse migration is also factored into the Republican administration’s calculations\\n\\nCarla Gloria Colomé\\n\\nMiami - Feb 25, 2026 - 10:53CET\\n\\nShare on Whatsapp\\n\\nShare on Facebook\\n\\nShare on Twitter\\n\\nShare on Bluesky\\n\\nShare on Linkedin\\n\\nCopy link\\n\\nWithout elaborating on a plan, President Donald Trump has hinted in recent weeks at his administration’s position on Cuba: he began by repeatedly calling it a “failed nation” that “will fall very soon,” and has ended by speculating about a possible dialogue with the Cuban leadership. Amidst all the anticipation surrounding what might or might not happen in the near future, one idea has received less attention, although Trump, very much in line with his domestic policy, has taken pains to reiterate it in several of his recent statements: the possibility that Cuban migrants will return to an island that welcomes them back. Or, in other words, including deportations on the negotiating table.\\n\\nThis is what happened with Venezuela in February of last year, when the oil-rich nation began accepting, after a long hiatus, the first deportation flights following a visit from Trump’s special operations envoy, Richard Grenell. At the time, Nicolás Maduro called it a “favorable and positive step” in relations between the two countries. Almost a year later, the Chavista leader was being ousted from power in a U.S. special military operation. Although all indications are that the strategy with Havana will involve economic pressure rather than a military intervention like the one carried out in Caracas, the issue of migration could also be part of the dialogue with the Cubans.\\n\\n“We are talking to Cuba. We have tens of thousands of people that were forced out of there... Maybe they want to go back. They’re going to have that choice... for years, they’ve been talking about this happening. Now it’s happening,” Trump told NBC News earlier this month.\\n\\nIt isn’t the only statement of this kind the Republican has made on the matter. In January, on Air Force One, he asserted that many Cuban Americans would be “very happy when they’re going to be able to go back and say hello to their relatives.” And at a meeting with CEOs of several oil companies at the White House earlier last month, he asserted that “there are many people in this country who want to go back to Cuba to help. They arrived here without a cent, had nothing, and have become very wealthy in our country. They want to return and assist Cuba.”\\n\\nFor María José Espinosa, a foreign policy expert and executive director of the Center for Engagement and Advocacy in the Americas (CEDA), these kinds of remarks align with Trump’s view of migration as a temporary phenomenon linked to political conditions that, according to him, could change. Furthermore, it could be interpreted as a message directed at the Cuban-American community in South Florida, Espinosa adds. “This rhetoric resonates with sectors of the exile community that have historically prioritized issues such as the restitution or compensation of confiscated properties, the protection of legal claims under the Helms-Burton Act, and differentiated benefits for the Cuban diaspora in a potential transition process. In this sense, the ‘return’ narrative functions as a signal, both internally and externally, about the conditions under which the United States would be willing to reconfigure its relationship with Cuba.”\\n\\nAlthough Washington’s intentions toward Havana remain unclear, the first deportation flights to Cuba in 2026 mark a turning point in the migration policies of both countries over the past year. On February 9, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported 170 Cuban migrants with criminal records. In a statement revealing some of their identities, the Cubans were described as “murderers, kidnappers, rapists, drug traffickers, and other criminals.” The charges range from second-degree murder to possession of an invalid driver’s license.\\n\\nThis is the first group of its kind that Cuba has accepted in decades. Until now, the government of Miguel Díaz-Canel had refused to receive criminals or ex-convicts who arrived in the United States before 2017, when deportation agreements were reinstated as part of the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Obama administration. Therefore, at least 3,757 Cubans deported from the United States in 2025 ended up in third countries such as Eswatini, in Africa, and, to a greater extent, in Mexico, where some 4,883 Cubans arrived last year.\\n\\nThe pattern of deportations to the island, however, may be beginning to change. “The fact that the recent flight included people with records of serious crimes suggests a possible shift—whether temporary or strategic—in Cuba’s stance toward the migration negotiations between the two governments,” Espinosa asserts.\\n\\nDuring January—the same month as the attack on Venezuela and when Trump declared a national emergency regarding the island—there were no deportation flights to Cuba. The following month, a group of Cubans who had been detained at Guantanamo Bay since mid-December were deported to Havana on the February 9 flight, which also carried the migrants with serious criminal records.\\n\\n“These developments suggest that migration cooperation between the United States and Cuba is increasingly influenced by broader political and economic pressures, with Cuba negotiating from a position of limited room for maneuver amid a U.S. oil embargo that threatens to plunge the entire island into darkness and trigger a humanitarian collapse,” Espinosa argues.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has had a particularly harsh impact on a community that for years had easily navigated the legalization process in the United States. Cubans have not escaped the orchestrated migrant persecution across the country, at a time when more than 500,000 citizens of the island find themselves in a legal limbo in the U.S.\\n\\nTrump has deported more Cubans than any other president, despite the Cuban-American community guaranteeing him a majority of votes in Florida in November 2024. During his second term alone, 1,668 Cubans have been deported to the island, bringing the total number of Cubans deported during his two terms to 5,053.\\n\\nMany, amidst a crisis like the one Cuba is experiencing today, fear having to return to a country without electricity, with very little food or public transportation. Roxana Torres can’t imagine her husband’s return; he has been detained for months at the notorious Alligator Alcatraz detention center in Florida. For at least four months, she and her one-year-old son have stood every Sunday outside the center demanding the release of Maikel Rojas Pérez. “I never imagined this would happen to us,” says Roxana. Amid the current economic embargo on the island, she lives with the “fear of his deportation,” of being separated from him indefinitely. “My husband is reluctant to leave; he wants to be here with his family.”\\n\\nDr. Luis Martínez-Fernández, a historian and migration expert at the University of Central Florida, believes Trump’s statements about Cuban migrants are part of “additional pressure” within a much larger package of “pressures on Cuba.” He also believes that conditions on the island are not conducive to receiving the millions of migrants who have fled in recent years. “I don’t think the conditions are right for Cuba to absorb a population that is already accustomed to certain things. I don’t think many will return to settle permanently. Under the current circumstances, the government cannot provide the people with enough food, drinking water, or electricity. And the last thing the Cuban regime wants is for emigrants to return in large numbers.”\\n\\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\\n\\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\\n\\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\\n\\nAñadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquí\\n\\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\\n\\n¿Por qué estás viendo esto?\\n\\nFlecha\\n\\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\\n\\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won\\'t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\\'s use this moment to reset. Let\\'s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\\'s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\\'t change how divided we\\'ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\\'d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\\'ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\\'s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.
